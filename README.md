#  Effects of normalization and feature selection on network intrusion detection system

This repository contains a complete experimental study on building an effective **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** using machine learning techniques, focused on evaluating the **impact of normalization and feature selection methods** on classification performance.

---

##  Project Overview

With the exponential growth of cyber threats, building robust IDS models has become crucial. This project explores:

-  The role of **data preprocessing** in IDS detection
-  How **normalization techniques** like Min-Max Scaling and Standardization affect model performance
-  The effectiveness of **feature selection** methods like Chi-Square and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
-  Implementation of ensemble models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression)

---

##  Techniques Used

###  Feature Selection Methods
- **Chi-Square Test** (Filter Method)
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** (Wrapper Method)

###  Normalization Techniques
- **Min-Max Normalization**
- **Z-Score Standardization**

###  Classification Models
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**
- **Logistic Regression (used in Stacked Ensemble)**

---

##  Key Objectives

- Analyze how different **preprocessing methods** impact detection accuracy.
- Use hybrid **feature selection** combining filter and wrapper techniques.
- Develop a **stacked ensemble model** for robust classification of network intrusions.
- Evaluate performance using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix.
